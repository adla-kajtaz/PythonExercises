# Exercise 14

### Product of List Elements

One of the exercises included in this repository is to create a function that computes the product of all elements in a list of integers.

### Steps to Implement the Product Function:

1. Define the Function

   - Create a function named `product` that accepts one argument: `numbers`, which is a list of integers.

2. Initialize the Result

   - Inside the function, initialize a variable `result` to 1. This will be used to accumulate the product of the numbers.

3. Iterate Over the List

   - Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the `numbers` list.
   - For each element in the list, multiply `result` by the current element.

4. Return the Result

   - After the loop completes, return the final value of `result`.
