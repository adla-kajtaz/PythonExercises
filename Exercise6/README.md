# Exercise 6

### Number Guessing Game

One of the exercises included in this repository is a simple number guessing game. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 10, and the player will have 3 guesses to try and guess the correct number.

### Steps to Implement the Number Guessing Game:

1. Import the Random Module

   - Import the `randint` function from the `random` module to generate a random number.

2. Generate a Random Number

   - Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and store it in a variable.

3. Initialize the Number of Guesses

   - Initialize a variable `guesses_left` with the value 3. This variable will keep track of how many guesses the player has left.

4. Create the Game Loop

   - Ask for the Player's Guess
   - Check the Guess
   - Handle the Losing Case
