# Exercise 7

### Even Number Checker

One of the exercises included in this repository is a even number checker. An even number is a number that is divisible by 2 without a remainder. The function will take a number as input and return `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.

### Steps to Implement the Even Number Checker:

1. Define the Function

   - Define a function named `is_even` that takes a single parameter `x`.

2. Check if the Number is Even
   - The function will take a number as input and return `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.
