# Exercise 1

### Pig Latin Translator

One of the exercises in this repository is a Pig Latin translator. Pig Latin is a language game where you move the first letter of a word to the end and add "ay."
For example, "Python" becomes "ythonpay."

### Steps to Implement the Pig Latin Translator:

1. Ask the user to input a word in English.
2. Ensure the user entered a valid word.
3. Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
4. Display the translation result.
