# Exercise 16

### Reverse Function

One of the exercises included in this repository is to create a function that reverses a given string.

### Steps to Implement the Reverse Function:

1. Define the Function

   - Create a function named `reverse` that accepts one argument: `text`, which is the string to be reversed.

2. Initialize an Empty String

   - Inside the function, initialize an empty string `word` to build the reversed string.

3. Iterate Over the String in Reverse

   - Determine the length of the string `text` and use a while loop to iterate from the last character to the first.
   - In each iteration, append the character at the current position to `word`.

4. Return the Reversed String

   - After the loop completes, return `word`.
