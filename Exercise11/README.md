# Exercise 11

### Count Function

One of the exercises included in this repository is to implement a function that counts the occurrences of an item in a list.

### Steps to Implement the Count Function:

1. Define the Function

   - Create a function named `count` that accepts two arguments: `sequence` and `item`.

2. Initialize a Counter

   - Inside the function, initialize a variable `count` to 0. This will keep track of the number of occurrences.

3. Iterate Over the Sequence

   - Use a for loop to iterate over each element in `sequence`.
   - Inside the loop, check if the current element is equal to `item`.
   - If they are equal, increment the `count` by 1.

4. Return the Result

   - After the loop completes, return the `count`.
